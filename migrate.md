Hey guys, Jason here with Jacksonville IT Pros.

I wanted to take a second and cover Azure Migrate at a high level. I want to cover the what, why, and how of Azure Migrate. Then discuss some next steps for those thinking about making the leap into the cloud. So without further a due, lets get into it. 

# THE WHAT
Let's break this down into two parts - the tool and the stuff.
 ## The stuff
  We're talking about virtual machines and data. Business have employees who log into computers, send email, create and consume files. This means they'll likley have an Active Directory Domain Controller, a file server, maybe some accounting software, and possibly even a SQL server or two.

  These everyone is running virtualized environements, menaing each server doesn't need it's own computer, but instead runs on a hypervisor as Virtual Machines.

 ## The tool 
  This leads us to the tool, Azure Migrate. This is a free product you can and should use to rehost your VMs and data onto Azure's infrastructure. This is often referred to as a lift and shift, because the tool essentially copy/pastes your stuff, bit by bit, from your computers to Azures. Itâ€™s actually pretty cool!

# THIS LEADS TO THE WHY
 Why use Azure Migrate and Why move to the cloud
 These are reaponble questions to ask. Becuase everyone else is doing it is a dumb reason, so lets dig just a little

 ## Cost is a huge reason
  Servers are expensive. 
  The software to operate the servers are expensive,
  And the IT folks that can properly manage a virtualized environment are expensive. When you add all these up, it's still possible if not likley, you could be spending Cadalac money, but rolling in a Kia.   

 ## The next most common reason is security
  It's hard to stay ahead of the constently chaning technology landscape, not to mention all the regulatory requirements. Then when you consider there are bad actors out there just scanning the internet with the hopes they can find any foothold, it makes a technologiest job kinda tough. Getting into the cloud unlocks a whole new world of security tools to make the system admin's life esier and go one more day without being the next Target and give up all your customers credit cards to the bad guys. 

 ## This takes me to Reliability
  At the end of the day, you can't beat entropy. So beit a vendor who lets in the bad guys, like in the case of the Target breach, or a huricane levels your building, a backstop is key.

  It really surprises me how little concern is given to testing the backups. At the end of the day, this is the backstop and the thing that seperates a business from closing up shop and selling off thier assests. 

  
# HOW
 Simply put, With the [cloud adoption framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/overview) and intentionality. 
 
 To borrow a line from Simon Sink, you should start with why. The [SMART](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/assessments/Strategic-Migration-Assessment/) assessment sounds corny, I konw, but actually is a great way to get your executives, IT, and stakeholders on the same page and speaking the same language. 
 
 This type of inentionality will pay dividens on the backend because you'll have the benifit of learning from the mistakes of others before you. 
 
# So What Next
 Microsoft vets and recomends partners that can help you along cloud adoption journey, like [Jacksonville IT Pros](https://jacksonvilleitpros.com/) for example. 

 You can also make this happen on your own. [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/m365-azure-migrate-virtual-machine/?source=recommendations) will hold your hand though the process and starting slow will give your team the experiance to manage and scale your cloud operations.
